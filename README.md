# NexposeAPI
Python module for the Rapid7 Nexpose RESTful API

This repo is modeled after the unofficial Python library for this same purpose published by Rapid7, but resolves some issues that I've come across in the process of using it that haven't been fixed because Rapid7 is not maintaining the repo.
